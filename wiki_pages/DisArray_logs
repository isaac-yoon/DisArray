- implementing demo login functionality
	- because my project involves modals for both login, signup, and demo-login, it was a bit difficult to determine the best way to implement demo login functionality

	- do I make a separate demo-login modal?

	- I opted to use the login modal and prefill values using a demologin user account that was already saved in 

- hit a pretty nasty bug involving and errors modals today
	- This is how the bug was created. I wrote some code that involved closing a modal upon submission of a form. 
	- This was written so that I could have a demo user be logged in and have the modal close upon login. 
	- There were no issues with functionality at first glance because a demo login user will always have the correct credentials. 
	- However, problems arose when a user attempted to login with incorrect credentials.
	- What would happen is the modal would close even if they attempted to login with incorrect credentials. 
	- Upon reopening the modal, the errors would persist. 
	- The desired behavior was the errors would be cleared upon the modal closing. 
	- The errors state would only be updated when after another login attempt. 
	- The solution was to only reset the input fields and close the modal upon a successful processing of form rather than always doing it upon submission.
	- Code should be under session_form.jsx under the handleSubmit function.

- Image Rendering on Heroku
	- had to refactor code
		1. use rails helper method image_url('')
		2. attach image onto windows in application.html.erb

- Routing issue
	- How do I redirect to the home page when a user types in a /randomlettershere?
		- Issue: using switch only allows the developer to render one component
		- Have a route that with an exact path "/" and render a null component
		- Below it, have a Redirect path = "/" that redirects to the home page
